					HackYeah! This is more than a coding challenge — it’s the biggest hackathon in Europe, a 24-hour
					programming adventure where innovation meets adrenaline. Are you ready to push your limits and
					create something groundbreaking? Join us on 3-4 October 2026 at Tauron Arena Krakow for the 12th
					edition of HackYeah!

					WHAT’S WAITING FOR YOU?
				</h3>
				<p className="leading-[28px] text-[17px] text-left caret-[#dbdbdb] mt-0 mb-5">
					For 24 hours, you and your team (1 to 6 people) will tackle carefully selected challenges, competing
					for fame, glory, and awesome prizes. Before the event, you’ll choose a task from our website, here
					they’re briefly described – the full details are revealed only when coding begins. That way, every
					team has a fair shot at solving them.
					<br />
					<br />
					Not enough? Change the space and check out the lectures given during the HackYeah conference! It’s
					not just about coding – you’ll also get the chance to learn from industry experts and expand your
					knowledge.
					<br />
					<br />
					To succeed, you’ll need strong programming skills, but great projects require more than just code.
					If you’re into UI/UX, testing, or graphic design, you’ll find your place here too! Smooth management
					and presenting skills are in demand too, so whether you’re a programmer, a project manager, or a
					natural communicator, there’s room for you to shine. Plus, expert mentors will be on-site, ready to
					support you whenever you need a fresh perspective.
				</p>

					WHO CAN JOIN?
				</h3>
				<p className="leading-[28px] text-[17px] text-left caret-[#dbdbdb] my-0">
					We’re looking for programmers – from backend wizards to frontend magicians and full-stack ninjas.
					But great teams need variety! UX/UI designers, testers, and other creative minds are welcome to
					bring ideas to life. You can join solo or with a team. Just one important note: all participants
					must be 18 or older.
					<br />
					<br />
					Think you’ve got what it takes? Pick a challenge, gather your team, and get ready to code for 24
					hours. HackYeah is waiting – will you take the challenge?
