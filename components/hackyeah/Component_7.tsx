						Second genome times ten – the human microbiome and the future of medicine
					</h2>
					<p className="caret-[#f7f7f7] my-0">
						The human gut microbiome, the community of bacteria, archaea, and other microorganisms inhabiting
						our intestines, has emerged as a critical factor in disease diagnosis and treatment
						stratification. Despite its recognized importance, it remains challenging to study due to its vast
						complexity and strong individual variability. At the same time, the microbiome offers a promising
						target for intervention: future biotherapeutics may deliberately reshape its composition to
						achieve therapeutic benefits. Even today, lifestyle changes, dietary interventions, and probiotics
						can influence it. By studying individualized responses to such interventions, we are beginning to
						uncover the principles that will enable the development of foundation models and, ultimately,
						digital twins of the microbiome.
