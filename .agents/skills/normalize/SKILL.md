Analyze and redesign the feature to perfectly match our design system standards, aesthetics, and established patterns.

## Plan

Before making changes, deeply understand the context:

1. **Discover the design system**: Search for design system documentation, UI guidelines, component libraries, or style guides (grep for "design system", "ui guide", "style guide", etc.). Study it thoroughly until you understand:
   - Core design principles and aesthetic direction
   - Target audience and personas
   - Component patterns and conventions
   - Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
   
   **CRITICAL**: If something isn't clear, ask. Don't guess at design system principles.

2. **Analyze the current feature**: Assess what works and what doesn't:
   - Where does it deviate from design system patterns?
   - Which inconsistencies are cosmetic vs. functional?
   - What's the root cause—missing tokens, one-off implementations, or conceptual misalignment?

3. **Create a normalization plan**: Define specific changes that will align the feature with the design system:
   - Which components can be replaced with design system equivalents?
   - Which styles need to use design tokens instead of hard-coded values?
   - How can UX patterns match established user flows?
   
   **IMPORTANT**: Great design is effective design. Prioritize UX consistency and usability over visual polish alone. Think through the best possible experience for your use case and personas first.

## Execute

Systematically address all inconsistencies across these dimensions:

- **Typography**: Use design system fonts, sizes, weights, and line heights. Replace hard-coded values with typographic tokens or classes.
- **Color & Theme**: Apply design system color tokens. Remove one-off color choices that break the palette.
- **Spacing & Layout**: Use spacing tokens (margins, padding, gaps). Align with grid systems and layout patterns used elsewhere.
- **Components**: Replace custom implementations with design system components. Ensure props and variants match established patterns.
- **Motion & Interaction**: Match animation timing, easing, and interaction patterns to other features.
- **Responsive Behavior**: Ensure breakpoints and responsive patterns align with design system standards.
- **Accessibility**: Verify contrast ratios, focus states, ARIA labels match design system requirements.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Match information hierarchy and complexity management to established patterns.

**NEVER**:
- Create new one-off components when design system equivalents exist
- Hard-code values that should use design tokens
- Introduce new patterns that diverge from the design system
- Compromise accessibility for visual consistency

This is not an exhaustive list—apply judgment to identify all areas needing normalization.

## Clean Up

After normalization, ensure code quality:

- **Consolidate reusable components**: If you created new components that should be shared, move them to the design system or shared UI component path.
- **Remove orphaned code**: Delete unused implementations, styles, or files made obsolete by normalization.
- **Verify quality**: Lint, type-check, and test according to repository guidelines. Ensure normalization didn't introduce regressions.
- **Ensure DRYness**: Look for duplication introduced during refactoring and consolidate.

Remember: You are a brilliant frontend designer with impeccable taste, equally strong in UX and UI. Your attention to detail and eye for end-to-end user experience is world class. Execute with precision and thoroughness.
